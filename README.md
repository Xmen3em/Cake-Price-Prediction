# Machine Learning Task: Cake Price Prediction

## Objective

The task is to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of cakes based on their features.

## Dataset

You are provided with a dataset containing the following features:

- Sold_On: The day on which the cake has been sold (e.g., Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday).
- Size: The size of the cake (e.g., small, medium, large).
- Ingredients_Cost: The cost of the ingredients used to make the cake.
- Design_Complexity: The complexity of the cake's design (e.g., simple, complex).
- Time_Taken: The time taken to make the cake (in hours).
- Price: The price of the cake.
- Amount: The amount of similar cakes sold in the same order (Price and all other parameters are for one cake, not the whole order).
- Gender: The gender of person ordering the cake(s).
