1. there is a low positive correlation between (price) and (time taken) 

2. there is a low negative correlation between (price) and (amount) 

3. there is a high positive correlation between (price) and (ingredients_cost) 

4. There are no outlies 

5. There are no missing values 

6. encoding categorical features;
                                    a- lable encoder (Design_Complexity, gender)
                                    b- dmmies(one hot encoder) (Sold_on, Size)

7. apply feature selection (ANOVA test) and before we apply (correlation matrix) we will ignore (Amount) feature as it has a low correlation and low score of ANOVA Test

8. i applied  a train test split with test size = 20% and train size = 80%

9. normalize the data by (StandardScaler method) as the standardization is carried out for features that are normally distribution

10. i used a 2 models (non-tree-based models) (linear regression models and support vector regression with kernel ('rbf)) 

11. linear regreesion is the best model with accuracy 97.72% by using the (r2_score) metrics and (MAE) is 0.1224

12. A discussion of any challenges:
                                    It was difficult to deal with standardization because when we predicted the data
                                    we found many errors, I dealt with this point by applying standardization after applying
                                    the train_test_split on independent and dependent features and when I wanted to predict
                                    a new variable, I applied a transformation on some independent features and apply the inverse transformation
                                    on the prediction result
